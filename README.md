# Unit 1 Project Build A Portfolio Site

## Overview
This project will give you a chance to use the skills we've learned in class to create a site that highlights the skills and projects you'll be working on in SEI. You'll get a chance to use JavaScript to tackle interactions such as an image slider, a responsive hamburger menu, and quotes that fade in and out on a timer.

Make sure to customize the design and content of the website to make it your own.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you throughout the process and helping as you go.
